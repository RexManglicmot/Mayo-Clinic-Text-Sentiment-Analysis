## Introduction

Every year U.S.News publishes the best hospitals ranked within the U.S.
Although the list does not contain all the hospitals within the U.S., it
contains about ZYX amount. The top ranked hospital for 2022-23 is the
Mayo Clinic based on U.S. News methodology.

To gain a better understanding why the Mayo Clinic is \#1, I decided to
use a Text Analysis on comments made by Yelp reviewers. Thus, this
projects aims to understand user reviews through the Yelp platform,
which is aimed to provide reviews to many businesses, including
healthcare institutions (both private and public).

The metrics used to understand Yelp are as follow

This project is comprised of the following chapters:

1.  Webscraping Yelp Data
2.  Cleaning data
3.  EDA the Data
4.  Visualizations
5.  Plotting Word Cloud
6.  Plotting

## Webscraping Yelp Data

Yelp data was scrapped on XYZ via the [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/)
website. Within the search engine bar, I typed in “\### *Mayo Clinic*”
and used the first result to scrape the data.

There were 228 reviews in total and the goal was to scrape all 228
reviews containing 4 metrics:

1.  reviewer name
2.  reviewer location
3.  review rating
4.  review text

After various hours debugging the code and looking at html tags to
discern appropiate tags to scrape, I was able to obtain all reviews
within Yelp. Troubleshooting code included unintentionally scraping a
response from a Mayo Clinic official that accrued in more than the 228
reviews.

Nonetheless, below is the code used to scrape data. Mayo_Clinic file is
available within the repository.

``` r
#load libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)

#create an object to store the webpage address
url <- 'https://www.yelp.com/biz/mayo-clinic-rochester-12?osq=Mayo+clinic'

#convert the url to an html object for R processing
webpage <- read_html(url)

#create object to know page number on the webpage
webpageNum <- webpage %>%
  html_elements(xpath = "//div[@class= ' border-color--default__09f24__NPAKY text-align--center__09f24__fYBGO']") %>%
  html_text() %>%
  str_extract('of.*') %>%
  str_remove('of ') %>%
  as.numeric()

#create a sequence to iterate for page number
webpageSeq <- seq(from = 0, to = (webpageNum * 10)-10, by = 10)

#store items into empty objects
reviewer_name_all = c()
reviewer_location_all = c()
review_rating_all = c()
review_text_all = c()

#create a for loop to get values throughout the 23 pages
for (i in webpageSeq) {
  #need to create an if statement because the 1st page web address
  if (i == 0) {
    webpage <- read_html(url)
    #need to create else because webpage has more content than 1st page web 
    #address
  } else {
    webpage <- read_html(paste0(url, '&start=', i))
  }
  
  #reviewer name
  reviewer_name <- webpage %>%
    #return elements that I specify via xpath method
    #xpath is useful for locating elements
    #// means to search within entire document
    #* means to return any of the elements
    # div means to search within document with the div tags
    html_elements(xpath = "//div[starts-with(@class,' user-passport')]") %>%
    #look within a tag within the previous element
    html_elements(xpath = ".//a[starts-with(@href, '/user_details')]") %>%
    html_text()
  
  #reviewer location
  reviewer_location <- webpage %>%
    #location is within the same div tag, so use same code
    html_elements(xpath = "//div[starts-with(@class,' user-passport')]") %>%
    #location is also located within the span tag
    html_elements(xpath = ".//span[@class= ' css-qgunke']") %>%
    html_text() %>%
    #remove "Location" 
    #pipe remaining values that are not "Location"
    .[. !='Location']
  
  #review rating
  review_rating <- webpage %>%
    html_elements(xpath = "//div[starts-with(@class, ' review')]") %>%
    #within div tag there is an aria-label
    #contains function to look for aria-label that has rating  
    html_elements(xpath = "(.//div[contains(@aria-label, 'star rating')])[1]")%>%
    #ratings are not text, so must use different method and specify which 
    #attribute to obtain
    html_attr('aria-label') %>%
    #remove star rating
    str_remove_all(' star rating') %>%
    #convert into a numeric
    as.numeric()
  
  #review text
  review_text <- webpage %>%
    html_elements(xpath = "//div[starts-with(@class, ' review')]") %>%
    #look throughout webpage with the p tag
    #to get the first comment and not worr about business comment,
    #need to put in brackets
    html_elements(xpath = "(.//p[starts-with(@class, 'comment')])[1]") %>%
    #html_elements(xpath = ".//span[starts-with(@class, ' raw')]") %>%
    html_text()
  
  #appending to appropriate objects
  reviewer_name_all = append(reviewer_name_all, reviewer_name)
  reviewer_location_all = append(reviewer_location_all, reviewer_location)
  review_rating_all = append(review_rating_all, review_rating)
  review_text_all = append(review_text_all, review_text)
  
}

#create a dataframe containing appended values
Mayo_Clinic <- data.frame('name' = reviewer_name_all,
                          'location' = reviewer_location_all,
                          'rating' = review_rating_all,
                          'text'= review_text_all)

#view csv file
#head(Mayo_Clinic)
```

## EDA the Data

Next, I needed to load packages, load data, and run an intital analysis
on the raw data to better.

``` r
#load libraries
#install.packages('tidyverse') #had to re-install for some reason on 11/12/22
#install.packages('ggraph') #had to re-install for some reason on 11/12/22

library(tidyverse)
library(tidytext)
library(widyr)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(wordcloud)
library(igraph)
library(ggraph)
```

Now, let load the data. Instead of using the function str, let’s expand
my R code competency by using different functions

``` r
#load Mayo Clinic data
data <- read.csv('Mayo_Clinic.csv')

#get the names of the variables
colnames(data)
```

    ## [1] "X"        "name"     "location" "rating"   "text"

``` r
#get the number of rows in the dataset
dim(data)
```

    ## [1] 228   5

Ok, we see that there is the X variable which indexes the observations.
Let’s get rid of that column and check it if worked.

``` r
#remove the X column
data <- data %>%
  select(-X)

#get the names other than the colnames funciton
names(data)
```

    ## [1] "name"     "location" "rating"   "text"

``` r
dim(data)
```

    ## [1] 228   4

``` r
#View first 10 observations of the data
head(data, n=25) 
```

I'll never know because they rejected me via form email that told me to "keep perusing local options" after making me jump through many hoops and having me sign upfor the patient portal which I now have no use for.  Also the person on the phone kept interrupting me and flatly saying "I need something that I can put in as a code".Both the phone calls I had were unsympathetic and frankly a waste. I'd bet money no actual person looked at my paperwork. Just a machine that scanned for keywords. It gets worse. My parents got in easy breezy for Executive Physicals which are extensive but only available to executives and their spouses. Which makes zero sense. (Hint: the answer is elitism)

Problem is I haven't even been set up to see a provider. So I called and was not very happy with Missy in General Internal Medicine. A little kindness and an apology for the error, rather than insist it was a phone call from central that I failed to pick up, would have been sufficient. I asked why they didn't leave a VM? "Is there anything else you need?" was Missy's reply. Absolutely not.
    ## 5  I moved here for a surgery. I had a tumor on my adrenal gland, and they couldn't figure out what it was. These tumors are notoriously hard to diagnose. My endocrinologist, Dr. Naan, who is the head of the department, was disrespectful and didn't take my case seriously. The first time I saw her, we did nothing. As we were standing up to leave she tells me that 1/3 of tumors like mine are benign, and she says that like it's a good thing. I stopped and said that this means 2/3 are malignant, and she just says "yup" and continues walking out the door. I was in shock. I'm only 36 y.o., and I had been told previously that it was probably benign. I never thought a doctor, let alone a department head, would be that flippant about telling me I had a 2/3 chance of having cancer. Next session, I told her I was really stressed about that, and I had spent an hour w a friend talking about it. Dr Naan replied "uh oh, I hope you weren't drinking". So, apparently Mayo Clinic department heads think patients have to be drunk to be worried about having a 2/3 chance of cancer. She was beyond dehumanizing. My surgeon, Dr McKenzie, didn't do any education during our surgical consult pertaining to the surgical procedure, what I can expect to happen during surgery, or the risks of surgery. I wrote a review, that was supposed to be confidential, detailing the things he left out. The resident came to see me the day off the surgery and educated me on exactly the things I mentioned in my anonymous review, nothing more, nothing less. He didn't tell me I'd have a catheter placed inside me during the operation, and no one told me after either. I only found out bc I was urinating blood, and because of the pain. Neither my endocrinologist or surgeon made any plans to follow up with me after surgery to discuss what the mass is, and the surgeon wrote explicitly in his notes that a follow up visit was not needed....so no one had plans to follow up and tell me what the mass was. And they didn't. I had some questions that I messaged them, a resident called back to answer my questions, but he never mentioned what the mass was until I asked. Then he said he was going to bring it up. The tumor wasn't in the same place they thought it was, it was actually outside the adrenal gland, and the resident said the adrenal gland would have died anyway, if they had just resected the tumor and not the whole gland. However, the tumor was not even inside the adrenal gland. No one told me that either. I read it in a report, and I brought it up to the resident. The resident said the surgeon didn't bring it up because the surgeon could not differentiate between tumor and regular adrenal gland. This surgeon does many, many adrenal resections each year, he's regarded as highly skilled, and he's does do partial adrenalectomies...so how is it possible that this surgeon could not differentiate between normal adrenal gland and a tumor that's sitting outside but adjacent to the adrenal? The surgeon just didn't want to educate me on anything that a normal patient would want to know -surgery risks, surgery outcomes, etc. I really wanted just the tumor removed, and Dr Naan mentioned that she wasn't sure the tumor was inside the adrenal, but the surgeon never said anything about that. The resident said that no one could have known that the tumor was outside the gland. Between Dr Naan and Dr McKenzie, it's just more dehumanizing bs than I can take. This is hard enough, but add on doctors like them who obviously don't care about my case at all, and the process becomes exponentially worse. I cannot believe I moved out here, to try to get better care, and ended up with doctors like these two who have been so offensive and absent on my case. Choosing Mayo was a huge mistake, and I don't recommend them. Go somewhere else, anywhere else, where they treat people like humans.

As a retired  medical  professional the treatment  lacked  what I would expect from  a hospital which  claims  to be number 1 in the country.  I believe  that a person  treatment  wouldn't  be any different  at any teaching  hospital in the country.

Would not recommend but would find someone who is a specialist in the field in which you need help.Btw, a few months ago I was accepted but couldn't go.  I re-applied with sameConditions and they said nothing.  I had to call.  They"?   The Wizard of Oz person behind the curtain?  No, not that good. Who is the review board?  Not qualified as a facility to treat disease but maybe will give you a bandaid.The staff on the phone is better than the doctors.  But it is still like a dictatorship and who is leading this mess?It's a no go for me even if it's the last place on earth.  Best of luck to those who have underlying diseases outside the conventional doctor box.  Tread lightly.  Hope for the best, expect the worst. I had hope for this place but no more.  No more.

I sat on a 3 month appointment with Mayo clinic looking for answers. all they said was keep taking PPI's. NO! NO NO NO. stop pushing pills at people. ACTUALLY examine me or look at what's going on. I ended up with a TIF surgery in July 2021, and it failed 6-8 weeks later because that surgeon didn't do a Hiatal Hernia fix at the same time. Feels like putting a knot in a shoelace and pulling it through the same eyelet. Tried to get another opinion from Mayo clinic. the woman on the phone said "will this appointment require surgery"? I DONT KNOW THAT! then she said there are no appointments available for 3 months so keep calling back.Sorry that you are so overwhelmed right now, but at least TRY to service the people who come to you for help.

They called me back to say that there were no appointments for neurology because of huge demand. They don't do complete work ups . I called customer experience to complain that i couldnt get an appointment there for my father . Shannon in customer experience wouldnt talk to me saying it was against hippa violations. As a lawyer and a nurse I can assure you making an appointment for a patient does not violate hippa. They have no pt info on file to share therefore no violation. She has no idea about what she is telling  potential customers . The whole experience was ridiculous and just from my initial experience I would never recommend a patient seek treatment there.    They also said they dont take medicare patients even if they have the most expensive and best supplements and means to pay out of pocket. .

I traveled from Texas to Rochester for an appointment due to 8 years of health issues and struggling to get out of bed each day. I was sent to an endrocrinologist from the neurology department and I was so excited. I have so many health issues and a lot of it seems to be hormone based. I had an appointment with Diana S Dean. I brought a typed and printed list of all my issues. She high fived with me with her elbow 4 times, muttered to herself, took one look at my list and handed it to my husband. Asked if I wanted to be referred to the PCOS clinic, which I said yes to, I'll see as many doctors as I can while in the area. Then she stood up, said I don't think you have hypo or hyper thyroidism right now and walked out the door. That was it. No help at all. There is SO MUCH more to endrocrinolgy than that. Then we walked out to get the PCOS appointment scheduled and they are booked out solid. So here I am.... having spend $3,000 between flights, hotel and car rental... and I didn't get any help. Devastated doesn't begin to cover it. The Neurologist I saw was great but only confirmed I have chronic migraines and they are not curable. She referred me to the gastro department, women's health and chronic pain. However, they are all booked. So they want me to come back in a few months and even then 2 of the 3 are not accepting appointments. So I came all this way and I booked a week stay as the coordinator told me to and no one is helping. If this is how they function they should have a phone consultation for the first appointment and then set up all the doctors for you for one week. This frustrating, heart breaking and I have never been more disappointed in the medical system. And this is supposed to be the #1 hospital in America?? Posting photos to be seen. Beautiful campus. Gardener is doing great but other than that I am gut wrenched over this trip.

Friendly knowledgeable staff that take the time to listen and understand your concerns. We traveled from out of state and had all of our appts during the same week, we even added lab work and a movement lab that were done at the last minute. If you have the option of using this facility....do it!

Shame on you for taking advantage of us and insurance company and taxpayer dollars.

Just recently I had an exchange with a highly rated Dr. Viggiano I had never seen or met before.  I arrived for a procedure and was told after well more than an hour it could not be completed.  The doctor who was apparently to do the procedure appeared at the side of the bed they were in the process of putting me in. I was halfway on the bed as he came around to the left of me, stood very close to my face,  and,  in a VERY loud voice, explained they were not going to be able to do that procedure and went on to explain why in a  loud and condescending voice. This  took place in the recovery and the room you get ready to go to the procedure. it was not a large room and I am convinced that anyone in that room could've heard him shouting. I'm not sure what upset him but I clearly did. Afterwards,  I thought he assumed because I am older,  I was deaf and feeble minded. It was a most upsetting time and I hope somebody said something after I left.  While I was disappointed the procedure had to be rescheduled, that is clearly NOT what I am upset about.

A grueling week of very expensive tests. At the end of the week I had a consult with one doctor for less then an hour to review the findings. He only talked about one of the tests. I have to assume all the other tests were fine. But I am not sure how fine. Also, there will be no follow-up, on-site or remotely, for questions or concerns or next steps. Sometimes Mayo seems like very large, very efficient money machine. They are VERY good at sending you to a lot of tests; but not so good at telling you what the results were or what they mean, or in decribing what your path forward might be, or in providing any ongoing follow-up. If you want some great testing, in a well oiled machine; this is your place. If you want some detailed analysis of your issue, and ongoing support, you will need to find that seperately. All the best, David

When asked they said they deem necessary to. I said if i have to pay for them i should have been informed but no one informed me. They claim the dr during the tele visit had told me there is a charge for review. I told them to take a look at the video. It is INCORRECt. The dr never said that. They said they dont record tele visits. The doctors can say whatever tjey want but the patient is always wrong. This is unfair and i would recommend to stay away from mayo clinic. There is sonething shady about these people.. The dr in her written notes said she will have her assistance send some brochures which were never sent.The dr said she will call me once the review of requested imaging is done. She never called me back!! Instead expected me to figure out that i should check for her message in their portal.Disorgainized, shady, daying things that were never said/done. I would not recommend them..

This is by far and away the best hospital I've ever been to and received treatment at. The staff are friendly and helpful, and they actually go out of your way to make sure you receive the proper care. It's a nice change of pace from the local hospital that I would see my doctor at which took forever to get an appointment.

I would rather go to a veterinarian than a Mayo Clinic doctor.  I would get better care.

My experiences over the past year have led me to conclude that the high level of patient care I experienced in the past has somehow changed drastically for the worst. Yes,  I wrote the office of Patient Experience. Worthless. Did not even address the issue I wrote about and transferred  the blame to a department who were not even an issue.  I am disappointed in the care, lack of information, communication, and follow-up.

Surprised that the Mayo Clinic is known to be one of the top rated cancer facilities in the nation. With that being said, we DID NOT receive "top rated" care.  Traveled from NC to Florida to hopefully get some help. My brother has cancer and made the drive for an appointment scheduled for 01/05/2022.  We received a call early morning on the day of the appointment to find out the Dr that he was schedule to see was "showing signs of Covid", which I can assure you isn't our complaint. However, he was scheduled with another physician, Dr. Jones.  This "doctor" did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!! DID NOT even exam my brother !! Had a "cocky" attitude. Showed zero compassion, and needs his arrogance taken down a few notches. While the nurse was trying to talk, he basically ran her out of the room. What an absolute disappointment, waste of time, not to mention the money that this trip cost (which is the least of our concerns) and I can't express enough just how let down we feel. The young folks that work at Chick-Fil-A show more kindness and compassion than this doctor and I walk away feeling better about life!But not here!!!!

I had open heart surgery there in 2020. Their dental specialty department is awesome! I go there for all my medical issues. Every department runs like a well oiled machine. There is a reason they are best in world.

5 people reviewed twice.

``` r
#quick check to see and sum if any NA are in rating variable
sum(is.na(data$rating))
```

    ## [1] 0

``` r
#calculate summary statistics
summary(data$rating)
```

    ##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
    ##    1.00    1.00    5.00    3.39    5.00    5.00

Looking at the summary statistics we see that the median and the max of
the list is 5. What this means is that there are more of the 5 “ratings”
in the list than there are others. The best way to view this, is via the
barchart.

``` r
#create a barchart to count the values
ggplot(data, aes(x=rating)) +
  geom_bar(color='black', fill='steelblue') +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Dark2")
```

![](Mayo-Clinic-Yelp-Review-Text-Analysis_files/figure-gfm/EDA%205-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
#create dataframe to build stacked barchart
rating <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
total <- c((sum(data$rating == 1)),
           (sum(data$rating == 2)),
          (sum(data$rating == 3)),
          (sum(data$rating == 4)),
          (sum(data$rating == 5)))

#create a table of all the rating sums
table3 <-data.frame(rating, total)
print(table3)
```

    ##   rating total
    ## 1      1    72
    ## 2      2    17
    ## 3      3    10
    ## 4      4     8
    ## 5      5   121

The barchart is an tried and true plot used to plot discrete variales.
Here, we see that the ratings from 2 to 4, in terms of count, are
minimal comapred to 1 and 5;with the 5 rating being the most popular
amongnst the reviewers. Next is to see the distribution of such.
